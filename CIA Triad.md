### Cybersecurity Basics – The CIA Triad



##### The CIA Triad is the foundation of cybersecurity. It represents the three main goals of security policies and practices:



### &nbsp;1. Confidentiality (C):

&nbsp;        Protects data from unauthorized access or disclosure.  

&nbsp;   How to ensure: Encryption, strong passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA), VPNs, secure communication (HTTPS, SSH).  

&nbsp;   Examples of Confidentiality breaches:  

&nbsp;      - Hackers stealing customer credit card data.  

&nbsp;      - Using HTTP instead of HTTPS, allowing attackers to sniff traffic.  



### &nbsp;2. Integrity (I): 

&nbsp;       Ensures that data remains accurate, complete, and unaltered.  

&nbsp;   How to ensure: Hashing (SHA256), digital signatures, certificates, access control, version control systems.  

&nbsp;   Examples of Integrity breaches:  

&nbsp;       - Malware changing online banking transaction details.  

&nbsp;       - Tampered medical records showing incorrect patient information.  



### &nbsp;3. Availability (A):

&nbsp;          Ensures systems, services, and data are accessible to authorized users when needed.  

&nbsp;    How to ensure: Redundancy, backups, disaster recovery, DDoS protection, system monitoring, and timely updates.  

&nbsp;    Examples of Availability breaches:  

&nbsp;         - DDoS attack taking down a company website.  

&nbsp;         - Ransomware locking files and making them inaccessible.  

&nbsp;         - Server crash due to hardware failure without backup.  





###### Summary



Confidentiality → Keep it secret.



Integrity → Keep it accurate.



Availability → Keep it accessible.

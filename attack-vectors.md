# Cybersecurity Basics – Attack Vectors

An **attack vector** is the pathway or method used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems, networks, or data.  
Below are three key attack vectors to study in cybersecurity foundations.

---

## 1. Social Engineering
- **Definition:** Manipulating people into revealing confidential information or performing unsafe actions.  
- **Techniques:** Phishing, pretexting, baiting (infected USBs), tailgating (following into secure areas).  
- **Examples:**  
  - RSA Security breach (2011) started with a phishing email.  
  - Fake “tech support” calls convincing victims to allow remote access.  
- **Defenses:**  
  - Employee training and awareness programs  
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA)  
  - Email filters and anti-phishing security tools

## 2. Wireless Attacks
- **Definition:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi networks and wireless communications.  
- **Techniques:** Evil twin (fake Wi-Fi), packet sniffing, rogue access points, WEP cracking.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Attacks on public café Wi-Fi to steal login credentials.  
  - KRACK attack (2017) exploiting WPA2 encryption.  
- **Defenses:**  
  - Use WPA3/WPA2 encryption  
  - Avoid using open Wi-Fi networks without protection  
  - Use VPNs in public networks  
  - Monitor and remove rogue access points

## 3. Insider Threats
- **Definition:** Threats originating from employees, contractors, or partners with legitimate access.  
- **Types:**  
  - Malicious insiders (steal or damage data intentionally)  
  - Negligent insiders (accidental mistakes, weak passwords)  
  - Compromised insiders (accounts hijacked by outsiders)  
- **Examples:**  
  - Edward Snowden (2013) leaked NSA classified data.  
  - Disgruntled employees deleting or leaking company information.  
- **Defenses:**  
  - Principle of Least Privilege (minimum access rights)  
  - User activity monitoring and auditing  
  - Strong authentication & account lockouts  
  - Insider threat detection systems

## Summary
- **Social Engineering** → Manipulating humans to break security.  
- **Wireless Attacks** → Exploiting insecure Wi-Fi and wireless connections.  
- **Insider Threats** → Attacks from within the organization.

### Common Cybersecurity Threat Types



#### **1. Phishing**

&nbsp;      A social engineering attack where attackers trick victims into revealing sensitive information (passwords, credit cards) by pretending to be a trusted entity (e.g., bank, email provider).



###### How it works:



* Fake emails that look like they’re from PayPal, Google, or banks.
* Malicious links that lead to fake websites.



###### Defenses:



* Don’t click suspicious links.
* Check sender’s email address.



#### 

#### **2. Malware (Malicious Software)**



&nbsp;       Software designed to harm, exploit, or gain unauthorized access to systems.



###### Types of malware:



* Virus – attaches to files and spreads.
* Worm – spreads automatically across networks.
* Trojan – disguised as a useful program.
* Spyware – steals user data secretly.



###### Defenses:



* Antivirus, firewalls, regular patching, and avoiding untrusted downloads.

#### 

#### **3. DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)**

&nbsp;                

&nbsp;       Attackers overload a target server/website with huge traffic using a botnet (network of infected computers).

&nbsp;

###### Impact:



* Website or service becomes unavailable.
* Can cause financial loss and damage reputation.



###### Defenses:

* DDoS mitigation services (Cloudflare, Akamai).
* Firewalls and rate-limiting.
* Load balancing.



#### **4. SQL Injection (SQLi)**



&nbsp;          A web attack where attackers insert malicious SQL queries into input fields to manipulate a database.



###### Impact:



* Stealing usernames, passwords, credit card numbers.
* Modifying or deleting data.



###### Defenses:



* Use parameterized queries / prepared statements.
* Sanitize user inputs.
* Apply least privilege to databases.

#### 

#### **5. Brute Force Attack**



&nbsp;        An attacker systematically tries all possible passwords until they find the right one.



###### Variants:



* Dictionary Attack – uses common words.
* Credential Stuffing – reuses leaked passwords.

###### 

###### Defenses:



* Strong passwords, account lockouts, CAPTCHA.
* Multi-factor authentication (MFA).
* Password managers to avoid reuse.



#### **6. Ransomware**



&nbsp;           Malware that encrypts files and demands payment (usually in cryptocurrency) to unlock them.



###### Impact:



* Victims lose access to their data.
* Businesses suffer downtime and financial loss.





###### Defenses:



* Regular backups.
* Patch vulnerabilities.
* Disable macros in Office files.
* Security awareness training.
